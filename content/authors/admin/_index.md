I am a PhD student in Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of British Columbia working under the supervision of <a href="https://lrjconan.github.io/">Prof. Renjie Liao</a> and <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/cthrampo">Prof. Christos Thrampoulidis</a>. I earned my MASc degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering from the same institution. Prior to that, I receieved my BSc in Computer Engineering from Sharif University of Technology.

My research is mainly focued on understanding the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.02010">power</a> of neural networks, and how to enhance their <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.00692">reasoning</a> abilities, with a special emphasis on harnessing the potential of Transformers and Graph Neural Networks.
