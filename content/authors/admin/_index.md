I will start my master's studies at the University of British Columbia in fall 2021 under the supervision of <a href="https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~rjliao/">Dr. Renjie Liao</a> and <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/cthrampo">Dr. Christos Thrampoulidis</a>. I receieved my BSc from Sharif University of Technology. Before university, I was mostly involved in mathematics and I represented my country, Iran, at 58th International Mathematical Olympiad, receiving a Silver medal.
